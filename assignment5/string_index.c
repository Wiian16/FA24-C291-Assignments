Program Name: Buffer Indexing

This program will read up to 2048 bytes from stdin or until the EOF is reached and store the input into a buffer, then
produce a report with all unique words to stdout. For each word in the report, the following information will be
included: begin index, length, end index, and the word itself. The report will also contain the total bytes processed, 
total unique words, and total words found. For this program a word is defined as a any sequence of non-whitespace 
characters and the null byte (\0) is not defined as a whitesace character.
